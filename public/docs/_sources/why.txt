Why SCOT?
=========
Let's see why SCOT is (will become?) so popular...

Philosophy
^^^^^^^^^^

When Sandia’s IR team was looking for a system to capture its work product, they already had a great deal of experience with existing products. RT and its IR extensions, TRAC and Remedy were products that had been tested, along with several large SEIMS. For various reasons, none of these tools were adopted by the team. For some, the complexity of the tool prevented an already overloaded team from utilizing it. For others, there was a mismatch between what would be required of the team in order to use it and the reality of how the current IR process worked. From these frustrations and to fill the IR team’s need, SCOT was developed with these principles in mind:

  * SCOT should require minimal training to use and understand
  * SCOT should aim to always improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the IR analyst

Why Use SCOT
^^^^^^^^^^^^

  * Designed to be easy to use, learn, and maintain.
  * Real-time updating keeps team in sync and their efforts coordinated.
  * Automated detection and correlation of common cyber security indicators such as IP addresses, domain names, file hashes and e-mail addresses.
  * Alert centralization from a wide range of security systems.
  * Extensible plugin infrastructure to allow additional automated processing.
  * Full Text searchable knowledge base that allows the entire team to easily discover and learn from past cyber security events.
  * Open Source.  Hack it up to meet your needs. (Please share!)

Our current users state:

  * SCOT just works and never slows me down.
  * I'm putting more and more of my investigation notes into SCOT.  It has paid of tremendously for me and helped me discover several non-obvious patterns.
  * Aside from my e-mail client, it's the one application that is always on my screen.
  * Give up SCOT?  I'd leave incident response first!
