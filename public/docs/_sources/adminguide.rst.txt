Administration Guide
====================

Backup
------

SCOT supports on-demand and scheduled backups.  The backup script is::

    /opt/scot/bin/backup.pl

and will back up the SCOT's mongo database and the ElasticSearch collections.  The
backup is a gzipped tar file and will be stored in /opt/scotbackup.  Moving these 
backups to another system is left as an exercise to the admin.  By default, the
last 7 days of backups are kept in /opt/scotbackup and files older than 7 days are removed.

Manual Backup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I get it, you don't trust some fancy script to back up.  Here's what is going on behind the scenes.

#.  Back up the mongo database with the "mongodump" command.

    $ cd /directory/with/space
    $ mongodump --db scot-prod 
    $ tar czvf /another/dir/scot-prod.tgz ./dump

#.  Use unix tools to copy SCOT config in /opt/scot/etc

#.  ElasticSearch backup is more involved:

    ##.  if you have never backed up elastic, you will need to create
        a repo::

        | curl -XPUT localhost:9200/_snapshot/scot_backup -d '{
        |    "scot_backup": {
        |        "type": "fs",
        |        "settings: {
        |            "compress": "true",
        |            "location": "/opt/esback"
        |        }
        |    }
        | }'

    ##.  if you have already backup up once before, remove any conflicting
        snapshot (or use different snapshot name)::

        $ curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/_snapshot/scot_backub/snapshot_1
        
    ##.  Create the Snapshot::

        $ curl -XPUT localhost:9200/_snapshot/scot_backup/snapshot_1

    ##.  Check on status::

        $ curl -XGET localhost:9200/_snapshot/scot_backup/_all

    ##.  When complete, use tar to back up /opt/esback::

        $ tar czvf /home/scot/esback.tgz /opt/esback

    ##.  store scot-prod.tgz and esback.tgz in a safe place.


Restore
-------

Extract the timestamped SCOT backup tar file::

    tar xzvf scotback.201701211832.tgz

This will create a directory "./dump/scot-prod".  Restore the MongoDB with::

    mongorestore --dropdatabase --db scot-prod ./dump/scot-prod

Manual Restore
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Restore Mongo:

   ##.  remove existing scot-prod database::
   
        $ mongo scot-prod < /opt/scot/etc/database/reset.js

    ##.  extract scot-prod.tgz::

        $ cd /home/scot
        $ tar xzvf /tmp/scot-prod.tgz 
        $ cd dump
        $ mongorestore --db=scot-prod .

#.  Restore configs by copying backup of /opt/scot/etc/ directory

#.  Restore ElasticSearch

    ##.  Close ElasticSearch indexes that are active.::

        $ curl -XPOST localhost:9200/scot/_close

    ##.  Remove existing contents of /opt/esback::

        $ rm -rf /opt/esback/*

    ##.  extract esback.tgz::

        $ cd /opt/esback
        $ tar xzvf /tmp/esback.tgz 

    ##.  Make sure that /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml has the following::

        repo.path: [ '/opt/esback' ]
        (restart es if you have to make a change to the yml file

    ##.  Create the "scot_backup" repo if it doesn't exist (see above)

    ##.  curl -XPOST localhost:9200/_snapshot/scot_backup/snapsot_1/_restore


#. Finally, restart scot.::

    # service scot restart

SSL Certs
---------

The initial install of SCOT will use self-signed SSL Certs.  Please update these certs as soon as possible.  

GeoIP
-----

SCOT use the MaxMind GEOIP2 libraries and databases for geo location.  Please see the MaxMind website for details on how to update the database files.

Upgrading
---------

Pull or Clone the latest from github (https://github.com/sandialabs/scot). CD into the 
downloaded directory, run::

    ./install.sh -s

You probably want to do this when your analysts are not very busy.

CRON Entries
------------

If you are using /opt/scot/bin/alert.pl to import events you will need a crontab entry like::

    */5 * * * * /opt/scot/bin/alert.pl

To automate your backups::

    0 3,12,20 * * * /opt/scot/bin/backup.pl

Daemons
-------

A properly functioning SCOT has the following services running:

* ActiveMQ
* MongoDB
* Apache2
* Scot
* scfd   (scot flairing daemon)
* scrfd  (scot reflairing daemon)
* scepd  (scot elastic push daemon)

Depending on the Linux version, these will have init style startup scripts or systemd style entries.

Logging
-------

SCOT is a prolific logger.  All logs are stored in /var/log/scot.  It is highly recommended to set 
up logrotate to avoid filling you disk.  Create a /etc/logrotate.d/scot like:: 

    /var/log/scot.*.log {
        daily
        missingok
        rotate 5
        compress
        notifempty
        copytruncate
    }
    /var/log/error.*.log {
        daily
        missingok
        rotate 5
        compress
        notifempty
    } 

Manual Password Reset for Local Auth
------------------------------------

Let's say you forgot the admin password, what to do?  

1.  Run /opt/scot/bin/passwd.pl

    $ /opt/scot/bin/passwd.pl
    Enter New Admin Password : ***
    Reenter Admin Password   : ***
    {X-PBKDF2}HMACSHA2+512:AAAnEA:2/oQYlnzjibzWoCs2aPv:KAZIhhNUgPBw4M7ZOVU1/2yT/P07FRe2bhacBw6J6ru4jwFRM9dMpxOARc9IfxrQs7ltxSn1ceW76dgJ4kL0Ng==

2.  Enter mongodb shell and issue the following: 

   $ mongo scot-prod <enter>
   > db.user.update({username:"admin"},{$set:{hash:'{X-PBKDF2}HMACSHA2+512:AAAnEA:2/oQYlnzjibzWoCs2aPv:KAZIhhNUgPBw4M7ZOVU1/2yT/P07FRe2bhacBw6J6ru4jwFRM9dMpxOARc9IfxrQs7ltxSn1ceW76dgJ4kL0Ng=='}});

3.  Now you (admin) will be able to log in via Local Auth using the password you entered.
