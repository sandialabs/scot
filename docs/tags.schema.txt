Tag Schemas

There are tags and then there are "tags".  
Previously in scot2 we had two types of tags tags and sources.  
In the future, we may have "labels" (machine generated tags) and who
knows what else.  
That being the case, the tags collection will have records that track
the tag type instead of having a different collection for each tagtype.

tags
{
    _id         :   mongo assigned guid,
    type        :   string representation of type name "tag|source|label"
    text        :   "the tag string",
    count       :   total integer number of times used
    applies     :   [
        {
            type: "alerts, events, etc.",
            oid : oid of type,
        },...
    ]
}
