Overview
================================

Cyber security incident response can be a dynamic and unpredictable process. What starts out as a simple alert may lead a team down a rabbit hole full of surprises. The Sandia Cyber Omni Tracker, SCOT, is a cyber security incident response (IR) management system designed by cyber security incident responders to provide a new approach for managing security alerts, including coordinating team efforts, capturing team knowledge, and analyzing data for deeper patterns. SCOT integrates with existing security applications to provide a consistent, easy to use interface that enhances analyst effectiveness.
