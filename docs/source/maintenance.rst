.. _admin:

Admin / Maintenance
================================
Well would you look at that! There is a nice, pretty GUI interface for SCOT Administration.  
To get to this admin interface click on the gear in the top right hand of the page.

.. image:: _static/images/admin_pointer_nav_bar.png
  
Monitor System Health
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default admin page is a System Health monitor that presents current statistics about your server. The System Health Monitor is useful in debugging simple issues like full disk, low memory, or high CPU load.

.. _auth:

Auth (LDAPs or Local users)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SCOT supports local user accounts as well as LDAP(S) for those of you who have a central an LDAP setup.  Single sign on capabilities with Kerberos are not yet available, but will be in future releases.

When performing an Auth check, SCOT will attempt to validate the user/pass as a local account first before attempting to contact LDAP (if LDAP is configured). 

Local users / groups
####################

By default, one user is created for your ‘admin’ which is a member of these three groups.

:admin: Anyone added to this group has Admin in SCOT
:ir:  Default group for incident reponse team
:test: Useful when debugging or running tests 

.. image:: _static/images/admin_add_remove_local_users.png

You can add more users by clicking "New User" or edit an existing user by clicking on the |editIcon| edit icon next to their name. 

When adding a new user or editing an existing one, you will be prompted with this form.

FORM HERE

Setup LDAP(s)
#############

To set up LDAPs, simply fill in the LDAP information, and click “Test LDAP Settings.” If the test succeeds, SCOT will display a “Save LDAP Settings” button right below the test button.

If you have any questions about one or more of the LDAP configuration fields, click on the question mark in the application for details.

.. _backups:

Backup / Restore / Migration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SCOT supports on-demand backups, as well as scheduled backups.  Both  methods are accessed through the admin panel.

Once you click on "Create On-Demand Backup", a spinning icon |loadingIcon| will show until the backup completes.  The backup will then be listed  and available for download by clicking the |downloadIcon| download icon.  

Restoring SCOT will soon be supported from the Admin interface, but for now, you must restore from the terminal by running /opt/sandia/webapps/scot3/bin/restore.sh BACKUP_IMAGE_HERE

To schedule automatic backups, enter in the cron style schedule and click "Enable Backups".  These backups will be in the form of .tgz files containing the entire snapshot of SCOT.  The files are automatically saved under /sdb/backups/ and are rotated every 15 days.  If you want to adjust retention, just modify the 'backup.sh' script in /sdb/backups/backup.sh.i

.. _ssl:

Updating SSL Certificates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While SCOT comes with a self-signed cert upon installation, it is best to replace it with one signed by a trusted CA.

To update your SSL certificates:

1. Generate an SSL Private key

 * On any Linux / MacOSX system
 * openssl genrsa 2048 > private.key

2. Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

  * openssl req -new -key private.key -out scot.csr

    * Make sure the "Common Name" you enter is the same as the server hostname

3. Get the CSR signed by a `Certificate Authority <http://webdesign.about.com/od/ssl/tp/cheapest-ssl-certificates.htm>`_

4. When you get the certificate issued by the Certificate Authority

.. image:: _static/images/admin_ssl_update.png


* The private.key file you created in the first step
* The SSL Certificate generated by the Certificate Authority
* If the Certificate Authority has an Intermediate CA Certificate (most do), upload it as well



.. _alerts:

Configure incoming alert mailbox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to receive your high confidence alerts in SCOT, you're going to need some way to get them in.  There are currently three supported methods of doing so.
#. REST - HTTP Post (already setup)
#. Email messages to a SCOT specific mailbox (needs configuration)
#. Syslog (Not yet implemented)

To configure SCOT to parse alerts from by email, you'll need to first create an email box just for SCOT.  

.. image:: _static/images/admin_incoming_alerts.png

Great, now enter in the connection details in the Alert Collectors page (as seen above). Click the “Test” button to make sure SCOT can connect to your email server and retrieve alerts. If this doesn’t pass, the error message returned will tell you which part of the connection failed. If it does work, click “Save.” Congratulations, you can now receive email alerts in SCOT!

You may not want to receive alerts from just anyone on the internet, however. If this is the case, you can specify a list of permitted senders. By default, anyone from any domain can send SCOT an email. To avoid getting email from unwanted places, just remove '@*.*‘ and replace it with something like '@YOUR_COMPANY.GOV‘.

Parsing email based alerts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that you can receive email alerts in SCOT, you may want to define an alert parser. An alert parser tells SCOT how to interpret the alert so that it can be seen in a standard format and also broken down into sub alerts. This allows SCOT to extract other types of specific data i.e., message_ids, usernames, and other items that regular expressions can’t easily match. If no parser is defined, don’t worry, we’ll show it to you in HTML or Text, whichever form in which the email was sent. See Advanced Alert Parsing for more details.

Updating GeoIP files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The location and ownership of an IP address is determined using offline MaxMind databases.  Periodically, these databases need to be updated, so your location information isn't stale.  You can get a new copy of the location databases free `here <https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolocation_landing>`.  Go ahead and upload those new files into SCOT using the GeoIP update form pictured below.

GEO IP FORM UPLOAD HERE

Additionally, SCOT can use an optional paid database from MaxMind that determines the organization to which an IP Address belongs. If you have a MaxMind Organization Database subscription, you can upload the organization database here as well.

We recommend you update once a month. Eventually, this process will be automated, but for now it must be done manually.

Upgrading SCOT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently, to upgrade SCOT you will have to use the terminal. Follow the instructions for how SCOT was * :ref:`origionally installed <upgrade>`.
