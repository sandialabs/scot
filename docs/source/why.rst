Why SCOT?
=========
Lets see why SCOT is so popular...

Philosophy
^^^^^^^^^^

When Sandiaâ€™s IR team was looking for a system to capture our work product, we had a great deal of experience with other products.  We had tried RT, and its IR extensions, TRAC and Remedy.  We also worked with several large SEIMS.  All of these tools failed to be adopted by the team for various reasons.  For some the complexity of the tool prevented an already overloaded team from utilizing it.  For other tools, there was a mismatch between how the tool wanted the team to work and the reality of how our IR process worked.
From these frustrations SCOT was developed to these principles:

  * SCOT should be require minimal training to use and understand.
  * SCOT should always aim to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the IR analyst.

Why Use SCOT
^^^^^^^^^^^^

  * Designed to be easy to use, learn, and maintain.
  * Real-time updating keeps team in sync and their efforts coordinated.
  * Automated detection and correlation of common cyber security indicators such as IP addresses, domain names, file hashes and e-mail addresses.
  * Alert centralization from a wide range of security systems.
  * Extensible plugin infrastructure to allow additional automated processing.
  * Full Text searchable knowledge base that allows the entire team to easily discover and learn from past cyber security events.
  * Open Source.  Hack it up to meet your needs. (Please share!)

Our current users state:

  * SCOT just works and never slows me down.
  * I'm putting more and more of my investigation notes into SCOT.  It has paid of tremendously for me and helped me discover several non-obvious patterns.
  * Aside from my e-mail client, it's the one application that is always on my screen.
  * Give up SCOT?  I'd leave incident response first!
