First Steps - Logging into SCOT
===============================

Open your favorite supported web browser (Chrome, Fire Fox, Safari) and browse to the server where you installed SCOT. If this is the initial SCOT installation, login using the Admin user/pass you specified during install (or admin/admin if you installed via Docker).
