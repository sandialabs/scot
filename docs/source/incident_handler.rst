Incident Handler / Incident Commander
===============================

Some teams have the concept of an Incident Commander AKA Incident Handler, which is one person responsible for triaging alerts and assigning them to people.  This feature in SCOT allows you to easily keep track of the current Incident Commander by displaying their username in the top right hand corner of SCOT.

If you click on the current Incident Commander's name, you are brought to a calendar page where you can define the incident handler schedule.

Just click and drag to select multiple days on the calendar and when you release, a dialog box pops up, allowing you to select the user that will be responsible for that day.
