Tasks - Help a buddy out
========================

Tasks are used mostly in Events to note a unit of work that still neds to be performed; for example, "Pull pcap for 8.8.8.8 from 8am - 2pm".  Some people use these as reminders for tasks they have to do later in an invesigation, and some use them to request help from other members in their team.  

This feature has proven very helpful when working on large events, coordinating what work still needs to be done, and who is working on it.  The user creates an entry, and by clicking the dropdown selects "Make Task".  This task now shows up on the task list, and anyone from the team can take ownership of the task.  This way an analyst that just came back from lunch, or just arrived at work can jump right in.
